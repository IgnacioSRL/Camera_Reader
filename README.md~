# Camera_Reader

Description
-----------
Cam_Reader is a C ++ library for reading OpenCV images from a streaming video sequence (such as an IP camera) in an easy way.
The library solves the buffer problem using two different threads. This means that the library always gives the last captured image.
The method can be configured to fix the fps.

Usage
-----------
### Compilation
For the compilation you need to link QT and OpenCV libraries. Besides you have to include -std=c++11 in yout gcc statement.

### Example
```
	#include "cam_reader.h"
	int main()
	{
	Cam_Reader cam_reader("your_direction",fps_desired);
    imagen=cam_reader.get_image();

```
